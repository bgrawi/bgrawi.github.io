####About
GreenTeamHV.com is the result of multiple hundreds of hours and many iterations of The Green Team's site. What started out as a small Wordpress site evolved into a massive single-page app that I wrote from the ground up.
 
I designed the user interface and entire backend by myself, through which, I learned a ton about programming through. I wrote my own MVC framework for php (something I would not do again, but was a great learning process!) complete with my own frontend JS routing library that utilized HTML5's pushState.

####Technologies:

* HTML/CSS/JS
* Custom Frontend JS library
* jQuery (with various plugins)
* Custom PHP MVC Framework
* MySQL

####Features:

* Natural language searching
* RETS Data Feed syncing (listing data)
* Google Calendar/Contacts sync
* Full user management between other services
* Lead capturing and management
* Responsive Design
