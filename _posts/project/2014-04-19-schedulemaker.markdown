#### About
CSH ScheduleMaker has had a long history. The project was initially created by jQuery founder John Resig, and then updated in 2011 by Benjamin Russell. I decided that it's style was in need of an update along with the need to work on mobile phones. I choose to first give it a fresh coat of paint with a heavily-modified version of Bootstrap, which soon evolved into a complete front-end rewrite of all of the logic into AngularJS. This tool is now used by thousands of RIT students and it help makes their lives easier  

#### Technologies:

* HTML/CSS/JS
* AngularJS
* Bootstrap 
* PHP

* Completely new and fresh redesign
